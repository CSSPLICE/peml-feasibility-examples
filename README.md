# PEML Feasibility Study Examples

The **Programming Exercise Markup Language (PEML)**
is intended to be a simple, easy format for
CS and IT instructors of all kinds (college, community college, high
school, whatever) to describe programming assignments and activities.

For full details, see:

This repository contains a collection of example PEML exercise
descriptions written as part of a feasibility study. The full
paper describing this study is:

# PEML Examples

The feasibility study discussed in the paper above included a
range of PEML examples created from actual classroom exercises used in a
CS1 course taught in Java. From the paper:

> To evaluate the feasibility of using PEML, we generated PEML descriptions 
> for a collection of existing CS1 assignments. This involved choosing which
> assignments to work with and then writing and reviewing PEML descriptions
> for each one.
> Our goal was to cover a broad range of programming topics while also
> representing a variety of classroom programming activities. We also wanted
> a range of difficulty levels as well as styles within each of the topics
> selected. Lastly, we wanted a good balance between assignments that
> used pre-written unit tests and those using data-driven
> variable-substitution based techniques for describing test cases.
>
> We selected 60 problems from three kinds of activities. We chose 50
> short-answer practice exercises, which most students answer in a few
> minutes each as part of homework. We also selected 5 lab assignments,
> which take a few hours each. Then we added 5 larger out-of-class
> programming assignments, which students work on for several days or a
> week. All were taken from the CS1 course at our university. 

This site provides public access to the collection of PEML exercises
used in this study. The exercise descriptions are grouped into three
subdirectories based on the three kinds of activities detailed above:

+ [small-exercises](small-exercises)
+ [laboratory-exercises](laboratory-exercises)
+ [project-exericses](project-exercises)
