# Simple example of a problem that is assessed by executing code and
# comparing the result to the given string. This is not using test
# cases -- there are no input/output pairs since there is no
# input. No indentation is expected/supported.
# This is a Python example.
# Derived from jsParsons

# WARNING! This was not created by converting the .peml file to
# .yaml. This was hand generated for now.
