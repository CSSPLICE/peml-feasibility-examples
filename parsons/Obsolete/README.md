# Obsolete Examples

This directory holds examples created previously that are now obsolete
under the current PIF spec. They are here just in case we change our
minds again about something.

Right now, these are examples using an explicit representation for the
DAG. It was decided at the 11th SPLICE workshop at SIGCSE 2025 to drop
support for explicit DAGs, and use only the implicit representation.
