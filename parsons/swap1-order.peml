# Simple swap function assessed by the order of the blocks.
# Technically this is a Java exercise, but this is a moot point
# because the assessment is by block order.
# No indentation is required.
# Illustrates fixed code shown to students
# Illustrates a multi-line block
# Illustrates two forms of distractor. One is a "ganged" distractor
# where the user must pick exactly one of the gang (many systems will
# give visual signaling that these are ganged). The other is a block
# that cannot appear in the answer.
