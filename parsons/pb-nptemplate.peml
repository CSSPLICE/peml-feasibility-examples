blockid: starter
display: To prove that a problem X is NP-complete do this:
depends:

blockid: inNP
depends: starter
[.blocklist]
blockid: xinNP
display: Show that X is in NP.

blockid: algorithm
display: Create an algorithm to solve X (that might or might not use non-determinism) that runs in polynomial time.
depends: xinNP
[]

blockid: NPhard
depends: starter
[.blocklist]
blockid: starthard
display: Show that X is NP-hard.

blockid: choose
display: Choose a known NP-hard problem A.
depends: starthard

blockid: trans
display: Define two transformations.
depends: choose

blockid: t1
display: Describe a polynomial-time algorithm that takes an arbitrary instance **I** of ``A`X`` to an instance **I'** of ``X`A``.
depends: trans

blockid: t2
display: Describe a polynomial-time transformation from the solution for **I’** in problem ``X`A`` (call it **SLN’**) to **SLN** such that **SLN** is the solution for **I** in problem ``A`X``.
